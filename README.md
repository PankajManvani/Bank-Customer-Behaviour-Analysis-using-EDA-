# 💼 Bank Customer Behaviour Analysis

An end-to-end data analysis and machine learning project to understand bank customer behavior, predict churn, and generate actionable business insights.

---

## 📌 Project Description

This project analyzes bank customer behavior to:

- Identify key trends in customer demographics and transaction history
- Predict customer churn using machine learning
- Inform strategic decisions through data-driven insights

By leveraging historical customer data, we uncover how customers interact with financial services, helping banks to:

- Personalize services  
- Optimize marketing campaigns  
- Improve customer retention  
- Boost overall profitability

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Data Preprocessing**  
  Cleaning, transforming, and preparing raw customer data for modeling and analysis.

- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Visualizing demographics, transactions, and service usage to uncover patterns and anomalies.

- 🤖 **Churn Prediction Model**  
  Using machine learning to predict which customers are likely to leave the bank.

- 🧩 **Customer Segmentation**  
  Grouping customers by behavior and traits for targeted marketing and personalization.

- 💡 **Insight Generation**  
  Providing actionable recommendations to improve satisfaction, engagement, and reduce churn.
